## Shibbydex Extended
This browser extension is a fan project and is in no way officially associated with shibbydex.

### Building
To build and package the extension for submission, simply run `./scripts/package.sh` from the project root

### What does it do?
Right now, it allows you to view tags on any page where file cards are shown on the site. You can customise this by providing card aliases and restricting cards shown only to those with aliases to allow you to get a quick overview of whether a file has particular tags you are interested in.


Please note that the site already has an excellent and in depth search function, this extension is just intended to make browsing a bit easier and was a bit of fun to make.

### Potential Future Improvements
 - Improved options page:
   - Visual overhaul
   - Use a pre-populated, searchable dropdown for tag selection
   - Use an icon font (like FontAwesome) to provide a much bigger selection of icons over just built in emoji's
 - Allow all information about a file to be aliased, not just tags (ie, triggers, tier, length ranges etc)
 - Persist tag cache between site visits for faster loading
